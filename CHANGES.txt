Traits 6.2+ and Pyface 7.3+.

Build and continuous integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Explicitly require traits 6.2 and pyface 7.3 (#1666, #1668)

Release 7.2.0
-------------

TraitsUI 7.2.0 is a minor release which includes numerous bug fixes,
documentation improvements, code maintenance changes, and enhancements.

Highlights of this release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The migration from ``on_trait_change`` to ``observe`` is underway. As a
  result, TraitsUI now requires Traits >= 6.2.
* New display-only VideoEditor (currently only on Qt backend).
* Exapnsion of features for the new ``UITester`` including the ability to
  inspect UI object visibility / enabledness. Also documentation for testing
  has been updated.

Notes on upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* This release of TraitsUI now depends on Traits 6.2+ and pyface 7.2+. Also,
  deprecated code / modules have been removed. Namely, the
  :mod:`traitsui.image <traitsui.image>` module which was moved to
  ``pyface.image``, ``editors_gen`` modules, Editor and EditorFactory factory
  methods on Toolkit objects, and more.  For a complete list, see PRs in the
  "Removals" section below.  These were all generally unused / deprecated for
  sometime. Also, importing directly from ``traitsui.editors`` has been
  deprecated. Please update imports to import directly from :mod:`traitsui.api`
  or :mod:`traitsui.editors.api`.

Release 7.1.1
-------------

This is a bugfix release that fixes a number of issues since the 7.1.0 release.
Thanks to Corran Webster and Kit Choi for the patches.

Fixes
~~~~~
- Fix ``scrollable`` trait of a Group not being implemented on Qt (#1406)
- Fix icon button's clickable area too small for FileEditor and RangeEditor on
  Qt and OSX (#1383)
- Fix missing minimize and maximize buttons for dialogs opened on certain
  Linux platforms (#1409)

Release 7.1.0
-------------

TraitsUI 7.1.0 is a minor feature release which introduces a new testing library
and a number of significant fixes. Demo examples are also distributed as
package data such that they are visible via the "etsdemo" GUI application (to
be installed separately).

This release should be compatible with Traits 6.0+. Users are encouraged to
upgrade to Traits 6.1+ to stay current as future releases of TraitsUI will
stop supporting Traits 6.0.

Highlights of this release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A new :mod:`traitsui.testing.api` module has been introduced for testing
  GUI applications built using TraitsUI. See
  :ref:`testing-traitsui-applications` for an introduction. Builtin support
  has been added for testing several TraitsUI editors. More support will be
  added in the future.
* On OSX and Qt, there have been reports of missing UI view updates after
  a push button is clicked. While this is suspected to be a Qt issue, changes
  have been made to ButtonEditor, SetEditor and ImageEnumEditor to mitigate the
  situation.
* The internal logic for disposing an instance of :class:`~traitsui.ui.UI` is
  changed as an attempt to resolve AttributeError that occurs while a nested
  UI is removed.

Notes on upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* On the issue about Qt button not causing views to update on OSX, projects
  that have been working around the issue by adding ``GUI().process_events()``
  (or similar) in their applications may now try to remove those workarounds.
  However, the change that mitigates the issue in a production environment has
  implications for tests: The button's click slot is no longer invoked
  immediately but always invoked by the Qt GUI event loop. Tests that used to
  call the Qt button ``click`` method directly and rely on the event to happen
  immediately will now need to update their tests to ensure that the click slot
  is processed by the Qt GUI event loop in the same order as before. Consider
  using the new testing library which automatically runs the GUI event loop
  after each interaction (e.g. mouse click).

Future removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* :mod:`traitsui.image <traitsui.image>` has been moved to ``pyface.image`` more than 3 years
  ago and has since been deprecated. Previously it was scheduled to be removed
  in TraitsUI 6.0. This planned removal is now deferred to TraitsUI 7.2.

Release 7.0.0
-------------

TraitsUI 7.0.0 is a major release which focuses on modernization of the
codebase.  This release includes updating the WxPython backend to support
WxPython 4, an effort led by Rob McMullen's first cut at support, with
help from a number of other people, particularly Per Brodtkorb.  It also
updates the code to use new features of Traits 6, and just like Traits 6,
this release drops support for Python 2.

In addition to the modernization, this code fixes many bugs and adds some
useful new features, including:

- a DatetimeEditor to go with the new Datetime trait in Traits 6
- an API to add placeholder text to a TextEditor
- support for the LEDEditor in Qt

Finally, the documentation has been improved, adding sections about some
of the internals of the TraitsUI mechanisms.  Additionally, the Examples,
Demos and Tutorials have been improved and cleaned-up, including fixing and
unifying the demo viewer codebase.

Release 6.1.0
-------------

This is an incremental release without many new features, but with
significant improvements in the code base and numerous small bugfixes.
Probably the most significant change, but one not obvious to most users
is that we have moved away from using 2to3 for Python 3 support to using
a single codebase with the six library to patch over the differences.
This significantly enhances maintainability and development speed, and
gives a better path forward for future Python versions.

Additionally, this release introduces experimental support for PySide2
(also known as "Qt for Python").  Pyside2 was enabled as a potential
backend in 6.0.0 but there was no testing being performed.  As of this
release PySide2 is now tested as part of the CI system with tests passing
on Linux and OS X using the 5.11 release.  There are currently issues with
the 5.12 release which have yet to be fully investigated.

The one significant new feature that has been added to this release is the
ability to completely replace the rendering of TreeEditorNodes with custom
rendering code on Qt (due to the limitations of the Wx tree control, this
is unlikely to be extended to Wx).  An example showing the drawing of
sparkline plots in TreeEditor cells has been added to the code demos.

There has been a long-standing issue with the way that the Qt TableEditor
handled selections, and this release fixes this, matching the behaviour of
the Wx backend and the documentation.  It is possible that this may break
code that was written expecting the buggy behaviour.

Finally, there are a large number of minor bug fixes

Release 6.0.0
-------------

This release introduces preliminary support for Qt5 via PyQt5, thanks to the
work of Gregor Thalhammer which got the ball rolling.  Qt5 support is
not yet robustly tested in deployed applications, so there may yet be bugs to
find.  As part of this effort all occurences of old-style signals and slots
have been removed; and this has greatly improved stability under Qt.

This release also features a great deal of work at the API level to disentangle
the two-way dependencies between Pyface and TraitsUI.  This has involved moving
a number of sub-packages between the two libraries, most notably the zipped
image resource support and a number of trait definitions.  We have endeavored
to keep backwards compatibility via stub modules in the original locations,
but we can't guarantee that there will be no issues with third party code
caused by the change in locations.  We haven't been able to remove all
dependencies, but as of this release on the dock and workbench submodules have
required dependencies on TraitsUI.

As part of the latter work, support for TraitsUI Themes have been removed. This
was a feature that was only available under WxPython, was slow, was never used
in production code, and was not supported for over a decade.  Some of the
codebase remains as it is still used by the Pyface Dock infrastructure and
several editors, but ther long-term intention is to remove this completely.

Another long-desired feature was the ability to write toolkit backends for
Pyface and TraitsUI that are not part of the main codebase.  This is now
possible by contributing new toolkit backends to the "traitsui.toolkit"
pkg_resources entry point in a setup.py.  This work was accompanied by an
overhaul of the toolkit discovery and loading infrastructure; in particular
Pyface and TraitsUI now share the same code for performing these searches
and loading the backends.

The entire TraitsUI codebase has been run through the AutoPEP8, assisted with
some customized fixups and occasional drive-by cleanups of code, which means
that the codebase is generally easier to read and follows modern Python
conventions.

Finally, the testing infrastructure has been overhauled to provide a one-stop
location to run tests in self-contained environments using Enthought's EDM
package management tool.  Tests can be run from any python environment with the
"edm" command available and the "click" library installed with the "etstool.py"
script at the top level of the repository.  In particular::

    python etstool.py test_all

will run all relevant tests for all available toolkits in all supported
python versions.  The TravisCI and Appveyor continuous integration tools have
been updated to make use of these facilities as well.

Release 5.0.0
-------------

This release features experimental support for Python 3 with the Qt toolkit!

This is based in large part on the work of Yves Delley and Pradyun Gedam, but
also owes a lot to Ioannis Tziakos for implementing container-based continuous
integration and Prabhu Ramachandran and Corran Webster for tracking down
last-minute bugs. Python 3 support is probably not yet ready for production
use, but feedback and bug reports are welcome, and all future pull requests
will be expected to work with Python 3.4 and later.  Python 3 support requires
Traits 4.5 or greater, and Pyface 5.0 or greater.

In addition, this release includes fixes to support wxPython 3.0 and deprecates
wxPython 2.6.  Thanks to Robin Dunn for providing these improvements.

This release also introduces a DataFrameEditor which provides a tabular
view of a Pandas DataFrame, similar to the existing ArrayViewEditor.

There are also a number of bug fixes and minor improvements detailed below.

Finally, this release changes the default GUI toolkit from Wx to Qt. This
changes the behaviour of the library in the case where both WxPython and
PyQt/PySide are installed and the user or code doesn't specify the toolkit to
use explicitly.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Experimental Python 3 support (#230)
* A DataFrameEditor for Pandas DataFrames, similar to the ArrayViewEditor
  (#196)

  Editor. (#143)

Fixes
~~~~~

* Fix failure to disconnect selection listeners for ListStrEditor in Qt (#223)
* Fix layout of TextEditors in some situations (#216)
* Fix removal of _popEventHandlers not owned by TraitsUI in Wx (#215)

* when using File(exists=True), be sure to validate the type of the value
  first before using os.path.isfile()



Traits 3.3.0 (Feb 24, 2010)
---------------------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The major enhancement this release is that the entire Traits package has been
changed to use relative imports so that it can be installed as a sub-package
inside another larger library or package.  This was not previously possible,
since the various modules inside Traits would import each other directly
through "traits.[module]".  Many thanks to Darren Dale for the
patch.


Fixes
~~~~~

There have been numerous minor bugfixes since the last release.  The most notable
ones are:

* Many fixes involve making Traits UI more robust if wxPython is not installed
  on a system.  In the past, we have been able to use Qt if it was also
  installed, but removing Wx would lead to a variety of little bugs in various
  places.  We've squashed a number of these.  We've also added better checks
  to make sure we're selecting the right toolkit at import and at runtime.

* A nasty cyclic reference was discovered and eliminated in DelegatesTo traits.

* The Undefined and Uninitialized Traits were made into true singletons.

* Much of the inconsistent formatting across the entire Traits source has
  been eliminated and normalized (tabs/spaces, line endings).


Traits 3.2.0 (July 15, 2009)
----------------------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Implemented editable_labels attribute in the TabularEditor for enabling editing of the labels (i.e. the first column)
