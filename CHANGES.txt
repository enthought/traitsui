Traits UI Changelog
===================

What's new in TraitsUI 4.5.0

Fixes

 * Application-modal Traits UI dialogs are correctly styled as
   application-modal under Qt. On Macs, they will now appear as independent
   windows rather than drop-down sheets. (#164)
 * Qt CodeEditor now honors 'show_line_numbers' and the 'readonly' style (#137)
 * Deprecated `implements` declaration removed, use `provides` instead (#152)
 * Fix TableEditor so that Qt.QSplitter honors 'orientation' trait (#171)
 * Show row labels in Qt TableEditor when requested (#176)
 * Fix TupleEditor so that multiple change events are not fired (#179)

   if numpy cannot be imported (#181)
