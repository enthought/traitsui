Traits UI Changelog
===================

Release 6.1.1
-------------

A bugfix release to correct some critical issues with the TreeEditor.

Fixes
~~~~~
* Fix TreeNodeObject listener cache (#558).
* Fix tree node insertion (#561).

Release 6.1.0
-------------

This is an incremental release without many new features, but with
significant improvements in the code base and numerous small bugfixes.
Probably the most significant change, but one not obvious to most users
is that we have moved away from using 2to3 for Python 3 support to using
a single codebase with the six library to patch over the differences.
This significantly enhances maintainability and development speed, and
gives a better path forward for future Python versions.

Additionally, this release introduces experimental support for PySide2
(also known as "Qt for Python").  Pyside2 was enabled as a potential
backend in 6.0.0 but there was no testing being performed.  As of this
release PySide2 is now tested as part of the CI system with tests passing
on Linux and OS X using the 5.11 release.  There are currently issues with
the 5.12 release which have yet to be fully investigated.

The one significant new feature that has been added to this release is the
ability to completely replace the rendering of TreeEditorNodes with custom
rendering code on Qt (due to the limitations of the Wx tree control, this
is unlikely to be extended to Wx).  An example showing the drawing of
sparkline plots in TreeEditor cells has been added to the code demos.

There has been a long-standing issue with the way that the Qt TableEditor
handled selections, and this release fixes this, matching the behaviour of
the Wx backend and the documentation.  It is possible that this may break
code that was written expecting the buggy behaviour.

Finally, there are a large number of minor bug fixes

Release 6.0.0
-------------

This release introduces preliminary support for Qt5 via PyQt5, thanks to the
work of Gregor Thalhammer which got the ball rolling.  Qt5 support is
not yet robustly tested in deployed applications, so there may yet be bugs to
find.  As part of this effort all occurences of old-style signals and slots
have been removed; and this has greatly improved stability under Qt.

This release also features a great deal of work at the API level to disentangle
the two-way dependencies between Pyface and TraitsUI.  This has involved moving
a number of sub-packages between the two libraries, most notably the zipped
image resource support and a number of trait definitions.  We have endeavored
to keep backwards compatibility via stub modules in the original locations,
but we can't guarantee that there will be no issues with third party code
caused by the change in locations.  We haven't been able to remove all
dependencies, but as of this release on the dock and workbench submodules have
required dependencies on TraitsUI.

As part of the latter work, support for TraitsUI Themes have been removed. This
was a feature that was only available under WxPython, was slow, was never used
in production code, and was not supported for over a decade.  Some of the
codebase remains as it is still used by the PyFace Dock infrastructure and
several editors, but ther long-term intention is to remove this completely.

Another long-desired feature was the ability to write toolkit backends for
Pyface and TraitsUI that are not part of the main codebase.  This is now
possible by contributing new toolkit backends to the "traitsui.toolkit"
pkg_resources entry point in a setup.py.  This work was accompanied by an
overhaul of the toolkit discovery and loading infrastructure; in particular
Pyface and TraitsUI now share the same code for performing these searches
and loading the backends.

The entire TraitsUI codebase has been run through the AutoPEP8, assisted with
some customized fixups and occasional drive-by cleanups of code, which means
that the codebase is generally easier to read and follows modern Python
conventions.

Finally, the testing infrastructure has been overhauled to provide a one-stop
location to run tests in self-contained environments using Enthought's EDM
package management tool.  Tests can be run from any python environment with the
"edm" command available and the "click" library installed with the "etstool.py"
script at the top level of the repository.  In particular::

    python etstool.py test_all

will run all relevant tests for all available toolkits in all supported
python versions.  The TravisCI and Appveyor continuous integration tools have
been updated to make use of these facilities as well.

Release 5.0.0
-------------

This release features experimental support for Python 3 with the Qt toolkit!

This is based in large part on the work of Yves Delley and Pradyun Gedam, but
also owes a lot to Ioannis Tziakos for implementing container-based continuous
integration and Prabhu Ramachandran and Corran Webster for tracking down
last-minute bugs. Python 3 support is probably not yet ready for production
use, but feedback and bug reports are welcome, and all future pull requests
will be expected to work with Python 3.4 and later.  Python 3 support requires
Traits 4.5 or greater, and Pyface 5.0 or greater.

In addition, this release includes fixes to support wxPython 3.0 and deprecates
wxPython 2.6.  Thanks to Robin Dunn for providing these improvements.

This release also introduces a DataFrameEditor which provides a tabular
view of a Pandas DataFrame, similar to the existing ArrayViewEditor.

There are also a number of bug fixes and minor improvements detailed below.

Finally, this release changes the default GUI toolkit from Wx to Qt. This
changes the behaviour of the library in the case where both WxPython and
PyQt/PySide are installed and the user or code doesn't specify the toolkit to
use explicitly.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Experimental Python 3 support (#230)
* A DataFrameEditor for Pandas DataFrames, similar to the ArrayViewEditor
  (#196)

~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Change the default backend from Wx to Qt (#212)
* Add a Qt version of the ProgressEditor (#217)
* Links to demos in the documentation (#159)

  Editor. (#143)

Fixes
~~~~~

* Fix failure to disconnect selection listeners for ListStrEditor in Qt (#223)
* Fix layout of TextEditors in some situations (#216)
* Fix removal of _popEventHandlers not owned by TraitsUI in Wx (#215)
* Remove some old (TraitsUI 3.0-era) documentation (#214)
* Help button now works on Qt (#160)

-------------

Fixes
~~~~~

* Fix pypi installation problem (#206)


Release 4.5.0
-------------

Fixes

* Add development versioning (#200)


Release 4.4.0
-------------

The biggest change in this release is support for the new adaptation mechanism
in Traits 4.4.0.  Other than that, there are a number of other minor changes,
improvements and bugfixes.

Corran Webster (corranwebster on GitHub) is now maintainer of TraitsUI.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

* adding support for drop-down menu in Button traits, but only for qt backend

* adding 'show_notebook_menu' option to ListEditor so that the user can
  right-click and show or hide the context menu (Qt)

Fixes
~~~~~

* fixed NumericColumn to not expect object to have model_selection attribute,
  and removed more dead theming code

* fixed API bugs with the NumericColumn where its function signatures
  differed from its base class, but the calling code expected them to all
  be the same

* fixed bug which was related to type name errors caused when running Sphinx

* when using File(exists=True), be sure to validate the type of the value
  first before using os.path.isfile()



Traits 3.3.0 (Feb 24, 2010)
---------------------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The major enhancement this release is that the entire Traits package has been
changed to use relative imports so that it can be installed as a sub-package
inside another larger library or package.  This was not previously possible,
since the various modules inside Traits would import each other directly
through "traits.[module]".  Many thanks to Darren Dale for the
patch.


Fixes
~~~~~

There have been numerous minor bugfixes since the last release.  The most notable
ones are:

* Many fixes involve making Traits UI more robust if wxPython is not installed
  on a system.  In the past, we have been able to use Qt if it was also
  installed, but removing Wx would lead to a variety of little bugs in various
  places.  We've squashed a number of these.  We've also added better checks
  to make sure we're selecting the right toolkit at import and at runtime.

* A nasty cyclic reference was discovered and eliminated in DelegatesTo traits.

* The Undefined and Uninitialized Traits were made into true singletons.

* Much of the inconsistent formatting across the entire Traits source has
  been eliminated and normalized (tabs/spaces, line endings).


Traits 3.2.0 (July 15, 2009)
----------------------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Implemented editable_labels attribute in the TabularEditor for enabling editing of the labels (i.e. the first column)

* Saving/restoring window positions works with multiple displays of different sizes

* New ProgressEditor

* Changed default colors for TableEditor

* Added support for HTMLEditor for QT backend using QtWebKit

* Improved support for opening links in external browser from HTMLEditor

* Added support for TabularEditor for QT backend

* Added support for marking up the CodeEditor, including adding squiggles and dimming lines
