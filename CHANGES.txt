Traits UI Changelog
===================

What's new in Traits UI 5.0.0
-----------------------------

This release features experimental support for Python 3 with the Qt toolkit!

This is based in large part on the work of Yves Delley and Pradyun Gedam, but
also owes a lot to Ioannis Tziakos for implementing container-based continuous
integration and Prabhu Ramachandran and Corran Webster for tracking down
last-minute bugs. Python 3 support is probably not yet ready for production
use, but feedback and bug reports are welcome, and all future pull requests
will be expected to work with Python 3.4 and later.  Python 3 support requires
Traits 4.5 or greater, and Pyface 5.0 or greater.

In addition, this release includes fixes to support wxPython 3.0 and deprecates
wxPython 2.6.  Thanks to Robin Dunn for providing these improvements.

This release also introduces a DataFrameEditor which provides a tabular
view of a Pandas DataFrame, similar to the existing ArrayViewEditor.

There are also a number of bug fixes and minor improvements detailed below.

Finally, this release changes the default GUI toolkit from Wx to Qt. This
changes the behaviour of the library in the case where both WxPython and
PyQt/PySide are installed and the user or code doesn't specify the toolkit to
use explicitly.

~~~~~

* fixed NumericColumn to not expect object to have model_selection attribute,
  and removed more dead theming code

  differed from its base class, but the calling code expected them to all
  be the same

* fixed bug which was related to type name errors caused when running Sphinx

* when using File(exists=True), be sure to validate the type of the value
  first before using os.path.isfile()



Traits 3.3.0 (Feb 24, 2010)
---------------------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The major enhancement this release is that the entire Traits package has been
changed to use relative imports so that it can be installed as a sub-package
inside another larger library or package.  This was not previously possible,
since the various modules inside Traits would import each other directly
through "traits.[module]".  Many thanks to Darren Dale for the
patch.


Fixes
~~~~~

There have been numerous minor bugfixes since the last release.  The most notable
ones are:

 * Many fixes involve making Traits UI more robust if wxPython is not installed
   on a system.  In the past, we have been able to use Qt if it was also
   installed, but removing Wx would lead to a variety of little bugs in various
   places.  We've squashed a number of these.  We've also added better checks
   to make sure we're selecting the right toolkit at import and at runtime.

 * A nasty cyclic reference was discovered and eliminated in DelegatesTo traits.

 * The Undefined and Uninitialized Traits were made into true singletons.

 * Much of the inconsistent formatting across the entire Traits source has
   been eliminated and normalized (tabs/spaces, line endings).


Traits 3.2.0 (July 15, 2009)
----------------------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Implemented editable_labels attribute in the TabularEditor for enabling editing of the labels (i.e. the first column)

 * New ProgressEditor

 * Changed default colors for TableEditor

 * Added support for HTMLEditor for QT backend using QtWebKit
