ETS Demo Changelog
==================

Release 0.1.0
-------------

This is an initial release of the Enthought Tool Suite Demo GUI application.
The package itself does not include any demo materials. It relies on other
projects to contribute data files via entry points.

The application was initially hosted and advertised via
``traitsui.extras.demo.demo``. The functionality is now supported via
``etsdemo.main.main`` and projects are encouraged to migrate.
``traitsui.extras.demo.demo`` will eventually be deprecated and removed.

See README for further details on how to contribute data and to launch
the application locally.
