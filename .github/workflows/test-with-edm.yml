# This workflow targets stable released dependencies from EDM.
# Note that some packages may not actually be installed from EDM but from
# PyPI, see etstool.py implementations.

# wxPython should be included but it isn't because the test suite is currently
# failing on all platforms and GitHub Actions does not support allow-failure
# yet (see actions/toolkit#399)
