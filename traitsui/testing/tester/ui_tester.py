class UITester:
    """UITester assists testing of GUI applications developed using TraitsUI.

    See :ref:`testing-traitsui-applications` Section in the User Manual for
    further details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    registries : list of TargetRegistry, optional
        Registries of interaction for different targets, in the order
        of decreasing priority. If provided, a shallow copy will be made.
        Additional registries are appended to the list to provide
        builtin support for TraitsUI UI and editors.
    delay : int, optional
        Time delay (in ms) in which actions by the tester are performed. Note
        it is propagated through to created child wrappers. The delay allows
        visual confirmation test code is working as desired. Defaults to 0.
    auto_process_events : bool, optional
        Whether to process (cascade) GUI events automatically. Default is True.
        For tests that launch a modal dialog and rely on a recurring timer to
        poll if the dialog is closed, it may be necessary to set this flag to
        false in order to avoid deadlocks. Note that this is propagated
        through to created child wrappers.

    Attributes
    ----------
    delay : int
        Time delay (in ms) in which actions by the tester are performed. Note
        it is propagated through to created child wrappers. The delay allows
        visual confirmation test code is working as desired.
