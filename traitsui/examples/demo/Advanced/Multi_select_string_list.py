Creating a multi-select list box

How to use a TabularEditor to create a multi-select list box.

This demo uses two TabularEditors, side-by-side. Selections from the left table
are shown in the right table. Each table has only one column.

    # 'myvalue'. This is done using a Traits Property and its getter:

    # left table does not draw until selection passes through all rows.
