"""
Monitoring a dynamic number of threads

Shows a simple user interface being updated by a dynamic number of threads.

When the *Create Threads* button is pressed, the *count* method is
dispatched on a new thread. It then creates a new *Counter* object and
adds it to the *counters* list (which causes the *Counter* to appear
in the user interface. It then counts by incrementing the *Counter*
object's *count* trait (which again causes a user interface update each
time the counter is incremented). After it reaches its maximum count, it
removes the *Counter* from the *counter* list (causing the counter
to be removed from the user interface) and exits (terminating the thread).

Note that repeated clicking of the *Create Thread* button will create
additional threads.
