This program demonstrates defining and visualizing dynamic ranges.

A dynamic range is a range whose low or high limit can be modified dynamically
at run time.

You can define a dynamic range using the standard Range trait and specifying
the name of other traits as either the low or high limit value (or both). In
fact, it is even possible to specify the default value of the range trait as
another trait if desired. The traits used as low, high or default values need
not be defined on the same object, but can be defined on any object reachable
from the object (i.e. it allows use of extended trait names).

In this completely artificial example, we present an example of the first
hotel at the North Pole. The hotel guarantees that each room will be heated
to a certain minimum temperature. However, that minimum value is determined
both by the time of year and the current cost of heating fuel, so it can vary;
but each room is guaranteed the same minimum temperature.

Each guest of the hotel can choose among several different plans that allow
them to control the maximum room temperature. Higher maximum room temperatures
correspond to higher plan costs. Thus each guest must decide which plan (and
highest maximum room temperature) to pay for.

And finally, each guest is free to set the current room temperature anywhere
between the hotel minimum value and the guest's maximum plan value.

The demo is organized as a series of tabs corresponding to each guest of the
hotel, with access to the plan they have chosen and the current room
temperature setting. In addition, there is a master set of hotel information
displayed at the top of the view which allows you to change the season of the
year and the current fuel cost. There is also a button to allow more guests to
be added to the hotel.

Notes:
    - The dynamic range trait is the 'temperature' trait in the Guest class. It
      depends upon traits defined both in the Guest instance as well as in the
      containing Hotel object.

    - As with most traits code and examples, observe how much of the code is
      'declarative' versus 'imperative'. Note also the use of properties and
      'depends_on' metadata, as well as 'cached_property' and 'on_trait_change'
      method decorators.

    - Try dragging the guest tabs around so that you can see multiple guests
      simultaneously, and then watch the behavior of the guest's 'temperature'
      slider as you adjust the hotel 'season', 'fuel cost' and each guest's
      'plan'.
