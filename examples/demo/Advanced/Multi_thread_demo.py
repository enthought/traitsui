"""
Monitoring threads in the user interface

Shows a simple user interface being updated by multiple threads.

When the *Start Threads* button is pressed, the program starts three independent
threads running. Each thread counts from 0 to 199, updating its own
thread-specific trait, and performs a sleep of a thread-specific duration
between each update.

The *Start Threads* button is disabled while the threads are running, and
becomes active again once all threads have finished running.
