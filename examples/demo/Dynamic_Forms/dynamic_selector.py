"""
Dynamic changing a selection list, using Handler

One way to dynamically change the list of values shown by an EnumEditor.

This example demonstrates several useful Traits UI concepts. It dynamically
changes the values which an EnumEditor presents to the user for selection. It
does this with a custom *Handler* which is assigned to the view, listens for
changes in a viewed trait, and changes the selection list accordingly.

Various implementations of dynamic data retrieval are possible. This example
shows how a Handler can interact with the traits in a view, separating model
logic from the view implementation.

Demo class *Address* has a simple set of attributes: *street_address*, *state*
and *city*. The values of *state* and *city* are to be chosen from enumerated
lists; however, the user does not want to see every city in the USA, but only
those for the chosen state.

Note that *city* is simply defined as a trait of type Str. By default, a Str
would be displayed using a simple TextEditor, but in this view we explicitly
specify that *city* should be displayed with an EnumEditor. The values that
appear in the GUI's enumerated list are determined by the *cities* attribute of
the view's handler, as specified in the EnumEditor's *name* parameter.
